# Dot Evolution

A simple simulation of evolution mediated by natural selection in organisms represented by colored dots.

The dot species features traits such as:

- Radius
- Speed
- Parental investment
- Color

which evolve due to mutations and are selected in the population due to intra-specific competition.

The simulation can also be sped up or slowed down and generates statistics and graphics to visualize the evolution of the different traits.
